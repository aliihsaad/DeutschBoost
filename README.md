## 🌟 How It Works: AI Conversation with Memory

DeutschBoost's AI Conversation Partner uses advanced context awareness to provide truly personalized learning:

1. **First Conversation**: Alex introduces himself and adapts to your CEFR level
2. **AI Feedback**: After each conversation, you receive detailed analysis with a 0-100 score
3. **Memory System**: Your feedback is saved and loaded before the next conversation
4. **Personalized Learning**: Alex references your previous strengths, addresses recurring mistakes, and naturally incorporates suggested vocabulary
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Watch your scores improve as Alex helps you overcome specific challenges

**Example**: If your last feedback showed issues with dative prepositions, Alex will gently reinforce correct usage in your next conversation without explicitly mentioning it - making learning natural and contextual!

   - Conversation sessions table is automatically created with JSONB fields for:
     - Transcripts (speaker, text, timestamp)
     - AI-generated feedback (scores, corrections, suggestions)
3. Copy your project URL and anon key to `.env.local`
4. Enable Google OAuth in Supabase Authentication settings (optional)
